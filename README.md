# Reflection
The hardest part of making this whole web app was the setup of the react app because we didn't know how to start and how to setup any packages to start the react app. The whole design part was pretty easy to create, however replicating it was a bit hard because we forgot how to use css styling to format the whole website. The setup took us like a week because we had no idea what we were doing therefore, we found a video to follow through and format our recipe web app and used their base format to make sliders and other functionality. Then we customized the website the way we wanted it to look like, although we didn't replicate the design we made from figma, but it all worked out and made it function. We also used an api to get all the recipes and data, and imported to our web app to create the cards and sliders. The video we followed taught us a lot on how to use react and all the other packages that we can use to make animations on our web app.
